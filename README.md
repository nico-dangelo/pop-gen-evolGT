# pop-gen-evolGT
This project includes the Final Presentation given in Fall 2019. Linked files (images,simulation videos) are included with the full "PresentationPackage" folder and file "AUTORUN.INF" file.
MATLAB code computes 100 generations of allele frequencies in population genetics approach, and Mixed-Strategy Equilibria for given initial payoff matrix from Evolutionary Game Theory approach.
The script "PopGen.m" includes these simulations, as well as figure generations for snapshots at various generation "timestamps" and a video for the evolution of the allele frequency surface.
